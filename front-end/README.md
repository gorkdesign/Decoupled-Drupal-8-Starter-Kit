This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


Create a .env.local file in the front-end folder with the following variables. The client id and client secret are from the Drupal Client configuration screen here: 

`/admin/config/services/consumer/`

```$xslt

REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=[YOUR-CLIENT-ID-HERE]
REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=[YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET-HERE]
REACT_APP_HOST_DOMAIN=[YOUR-LOCAL-DOMAIN]
```
